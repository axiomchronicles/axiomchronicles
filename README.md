## 🔥 About Me

I'm **Pawan Kumar**, a passionate **AI/ML explorer** and **full-stack developer** who thrives on learning, building, and solving real-world problems. Whether it's wrangling data or deploying intelligent web apps, I’m deeply driven by curiosity and a love for clean, scalable solutions.

I craft intelligent systems using **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, and **Transformers**, while also building intuitive full-stack applications using **Django**, **Flask**, and **React**. My projects blend logic and creativity — like designing **Electrus**, a custom in-memory NoSQL database made from scratch.
